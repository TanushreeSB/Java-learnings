/*
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

System is a built-in Java class.
out is a member of System, short for "output".
println() is a method, short for "print line".
Finally, remember that each Java statement must end with a semicolon (;).
