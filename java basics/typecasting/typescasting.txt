Java Type Casting
Type casting means converting one data type into another. For example, turning an int into a double.

In Java, there are two main types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatic) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manual) - converting a larger type to a smaller type size
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
