- A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

- Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

- Methods are used to reuse code

- Information can be passed to methods as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.

- Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. 
- We can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma. 

- Method Overloading
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:
int myMethod(int x)
float myMethod(float x)
double myMethod(double x, double y)
