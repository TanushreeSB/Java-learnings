Exception Handling (try and catch)
Exception handling lets you catch and handle errors during runtime - so your program doesn't crash.

It uses different keywords:

The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The finally statement lets you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    } finally {
      System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
    }
  }
}
 
The output will be:

Something went wrong.
The 'try catch' is finished.

The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.
