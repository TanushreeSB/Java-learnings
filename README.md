## 📌 Data Types in Java

In Java, data types are broadly classified into **two categories**:

---

### 1️⃣ Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are **basic, built-in data types** provided by Java. They store **simple values** directly.

**Types of Primitive Data Types:**

* `byte`
* `short`
* `int`
* `long`
* `float`
* `double`
* `boolean`
* `char`

**Key Characteristics:**

* Predefined in Java
* Store actual values
* Start with **lowercase letters**
* Cannot call methods
* Cannot be `null`

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types)

Non-primitive data types are used to store **references to objects** rather than the actual data.

**Examples of Non-Primitive Data Types:**

* `String`
* Arrays
* Classes
* Interfaces

**Key Characteristics:**

* Mostly created by the programmer
  *(Exception: `String` is provided by Java)*
* Store references to objects
* Can call methods to perform operations
* Usually start with **uppercase letters**
* Can have a value of `null`

## 🔍 Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

| Feature        | Primitive Data Types     | Non-Primitive Data Types      |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Definition     | Built-in data types      | User-defined (except String)  |
| Data Storage   | Stores actual value      | Stores reference to an object |
| Method Support | Cannot call methods      | Can call methods              |
| Case Style     | Lowercase (`int`)        | Uppercase (`String`)          |
| Null Value     | Cannot be `null`         | Can be `null`                 |
| Examples       | `int`, `char`, `boolean` | `String`, Arrays, Classes     |
